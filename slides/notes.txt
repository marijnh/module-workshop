Hello. This workshop is going to talk about modules and module systems
in JavaScript. Because there is a lot of historical baggage in the way
we are currently still doing modules, the workshop is structured along
the timeline of the past ten years, during which the JS community's
approach to modularity mostly went from simple and deeply broken to
complicated but largely working. Though at times we also hit
complicated and broken.

JavaScript has the good fortune of being born without any concept of
modules built in. I say good fortune because, though it may sound nice
to have a module system, a broken module system is worse than none at
all. These are hard to get right, and there are many examples of
languages that started with a poor one and never really recovered --
think of C and C++.

I guess serious software engineering in the large wasn't really on the
roadmap when JavaScript was designed. I mean, I was never able to
verify this, but from the awkward required close tag on the `<script>`
tag, I suspect that even support for the `src` wasn't really part of
the original plan.

So what are modules, and what do we want from them?

For a long time, I maintained my code editor library as a single file,
which over the years went from 1500 to 8000 lines of code. And this
was actually nice -- you always knew what file something was in, you
could get the whole thing with a single script tag, and there were no
build steps to worry about. Having to deal with more than one file
definitely adds friction.

But if you want to use such a library in a project, you probably don't
want to just copy-paste it into your own giant script file. So library
boundaries are definitely a place where we want modules, so that we
can easily drop them into our project.

And even within a project, keeping some kind of structure can be a
very useful antidote for making everything interact with everything.
I'm still struggling to untangle that library I just mentioned --
forcing yourself to go through clearly specified and somewhat clean
interfaces can help a lot in keeping a system understandable.

So in the end it is all about interfaces -- splitting the complexity
of a system by comparimentalizing, and allowing reuse by making it
possible to write code against a given interface without worrying
about the precise source code that's going to provide that interface.
But most of this workshop is going to _be_ about how to make sure that
the source code that provides the interfaces we rely on is loaded and
that we have access to it.

It is 2007. JavaScript development in the large is starting to be _a
thing_. But we don't have much tools for it. Even build tools aren't
really used yet. So how does modular development work?

As our running example, we'll use a simple web app for practicing
simple arithmetic. For now, it consists of three modules, one that
implements the output/user input system, one that generates exercises,
and one that ties those two together into an actual working app.

Lots of script tags, mostly. Each script either adds something to the
global scope for other scripts to access, or just _does_ something,
and if you put the script tags in the right order, and don't forget
any, you get a working page. So the way the modules interact is
implicit -- they all have access to the global scope, and use that to
'communicate'. There is no explicit way to figure out what depends on
what.

A widely used convention is that each library would set a single
global, and those that depend on it assume the global is there and use
it.

And up to a certain point, this worked. In fact, many webpages are
still developed this way.

You'll find the initial, rather naive, version of the example project
in the 2007 directory. Right now, it's not using any external
libraries. Let's fix that. When was jQuery written? 2006, so it
existed in 2007. Let's add it. There's a README.md file under the 2007
directory in the code tree. That outlines the exercises for that year.
The main one is to update paper.js to use jQuery, and then get the
entire app to run.

Note that things probably won't work immediately, since I
intentionally put a problem in the code. Exercise 2 is to find and fix
that problem, preferably in a general way.

Then there's a few bonus exercises that you can look at if you're done
quickly. We'll discuss those afterwards.

---

So that last exercise involved having the files themselves declare
what they depend on, which allowed us to build up an accurate
dependency graph. Which, in this case, looked something like this.

As soon as your graph is deeper than a single level—i.e. our main app
depending on paper.js which in turn depends on jQuery, it gets very
awkward to load dependencies by hand, which is why we need tools like
loaders or bundlers.

Dependency graphs are great, because they help us automatically
determine what to load and in what order. They can also be helpful in
figuring out the structure of a project or seeing why it is pulling in
so much code.

So, is there anything still wrong with our approach? For one thing,
there's that global scope issue. Modules just _do_ things to a single,
shared, mutable scope, and if they step on each other's toes, for
example by trying to define the same global, things go wrong. Except
for C and emacs lisp, very few languages do modularity by just having
all modules happily shove things into a shared scope. Can we get away
from that in JavaScript?

Yes, we can, by abusing function scopes. In 2009, node was released,
popularizing a module system known as 'CommonJS modules'. The two main
concepts in such modules are the `require` function and the `module`
object.

    var jquery = require("./jquery")
    module.exports = function Paper() {}

If you call `require`, that _returns_ the interface of the module you
asked for. To determine what your own interface is, you set
`module.exports` (which is initialized to an empty object by default).

`require` does a few things. It resolves the string you give it to an
actual file—and having a _resolution_ step here, rather than expecting
people to always specify path names directly is important. We'll get
back to that later. If that module has already been loaded, it just
returns its interface from a cache. Otherwise, it loads the code, and
wraps it in a function like this, before calling that function with
the appropriate values:

    (function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
      // Module code ends up here
    })

You can actually see this if you have an error on the first line of a
module in node—the resulting exception will include the inserted code.

There are two important things happening here—firstly, the module gets
wrapped in its own scope, so variables created normally end up being
local, rather than in the global scope. This removes the need to
manually wrap your modules, which is nice. Secondly, the function
parameters are used to inject a bunch of module-local values into the
module.

`exports` is just a shortcut to the default object value of
`module.exports`. `require` is a function that _knows_ which module
this is, so that it can use the module's path to resolve other
modules. `module` is an object that contains that information, along
with an `exports` property that you can use to set the module
interface to an arbitrary value. `__filename` and `__dirname` provide
ways for a the module itself to figure out who it is.

That's quite a lot of duplicated information, for convenience I
suppose (you don't want everybody to have to write `module.require`
every time they want to load a dependency).

But roughly, that's all there is to it. You could implement that in a
few dozen lines of code. And that, of course, is what I'm going to ask
you to do. Module resolution can be really simple for now, supporting
only relative paths—use the `resolve` function from node's `path`
module.

---

Okay, now we have a module loader, sort of. But if we go back to the
browser, how would we apply it there? There's no `readFileSync` in the
browser. You can kind of do read-file, but the only way to do sync is
with a synchronous XMLHttpRequest, which is generally a rather bad
idea, because it will lock up the page for the duration of a whole
network request.

CommonJS modules are defined in a synchronous way, though — when you
call `require`, it is supposed to immediately return the required
module's interface. As such, it is rather poorly suited for use in
browsers.

There are two solutions to this problem, both introduced around 2012.
The first is the 'asynchrounous module definition' (AMD) system, which
is another style of module loading that is more friendly to
asynchronicity. The second is bundling, which we'll get back to in a
moment.

An AMD module looks like this:

    define(["jquery"], function($) {
      // module code
      return function Paper() {}
    })

The `define` function is provided by the module loader, and though it
is specified to take a whole zoo of different parameter styles, the
main one first an array of module names, and then a function that
takes these modules' interfaces as arguments, runs the module code,
and returns its interface.

This forces you to specify all your dependencies in advance, and wrap
the module code in a function (again), which can be called,
asynchronously, when the dependencies have been loaded.

The advantage of this is that, with a library like RequireJS (not to
be confused with CommonJS' `require` function), you can run such code
unmodified in the browser. The disadvantage is that it's a little more
awkward to use than CommonJS, and of course that it introduces _yet_
another module style.

The 'code reuse' idea of modularity only works if you can actually
load the modules that you want to reuse. And if everybody's has a
different idea of what a module is, that gets difficult. This is why
community-wide conventions are really important. If developers can
agree on a general framework for modules, their life gets better.

The JavaScript community's answer to that has been a total eyesore,
but it works. It is 'universal module definitions', which sounds
elegant until you realize that it's basically a bunch of horrid
feature tests to figure out which of the three dominant approaches to
modules, CommonJS, AMD, and global variables, the module should hook
into.

    !function(mod, global) {
      if (typeof exports == "object" && typeof module == "object")
        mod(require("./jquery")) // CommonJS
      else if (typeof define == "function" && define.amd)
        define(["./jquery"], mod) // AMD
      else
        global.Paper = mod(global.$) // globals
    }(function($) {
      // module code here
      return function Paper() {}
    }, this)

It's a miracle of human ingenuity.

(Note that this is only 'universal' until the next module convention
shows up, which, as you may be aware, has already happened.)

As of today, this is still pretty much how you are expected to ship
libraries that are intended for the browser. Since it pretty much
repeats the same information in three different way, each of which has
its own quirks, you can imagine that maintaining these is great fun.

But there is hope. I mentioned the importance of conventions a moment
ago. Which project has been a _great_ source of useful conventions in
JavaScript-land?

I was referring to _NPM_. It has provided us with a more precise
definition of a package, namely:

 - A package has a unique name

 - It comes with a package.json file that declares

   - What other package it depends on

   - What its main script is

   - Which tools/binaries it provides

   - How to install it

 - Uses (at least) CommonJS to define its modules

 - It comes with a README file that has documentation

 - It can be downloaded from the NPM repository

 - Once installed, it can be refered to with a simple
   `require("packagename")`

By doing this (and getting those conventions adopted), NPM has
resulted in a giant improvement in the ability of JavaScript
developers to distribute packages and reuse other people's packages.

(Bower sort of tried to do the same thing in a more browser-oriented
way, but was really poorly executed. Use NPM, also for the browser.)

NPM is of course also a command-line tool that helps you install
packages, and it's good at that, at least in recent versions, but I
want to stress that its main contribution was in getting the community
to agree on what a package is. (So that a separate tool like `yarn`,
which is basically a different approach to building a client for that
same system, can exist alongside it.)

Along with NPM came node's resolution algorithm, which supports
non-relative requires by searching in `node_modules` directories above
the requiring script, and if a directory has a `package.json`, using
that to determine the main file for this module.

So if you compare `npm install foo`/`require("foo")` to all the
decisions you used to have to take to find, download, copy, and load a
dependency, we're truly living in the future.

But all this doesn't help us very much yet when we are programming for
the browser. We can _download_ packages from NPM, but we still have to
add script tags to load them, or rely on a module loader, and hope
that they actually implement the module style that we need.

Enter bundlers. We made a very simple one before, but you can also
write bundlers for CommonJS or AMD-style modules. They are, basically,
tools that take a codebase spread out over multiple files, and turn it
into one big file that can be easily loaded in the browser, by
intelligently following dependencies.

CommonJS bundlers were pioneeded by browserify. This was a very clever
project that bundled code intended for node (back then putting browser
code on NPM wasn't really done) in such a way that it could run in the
browser. To do that, it came with compatibility shims for node's
built-in libraries, so that even if you loaded a module that tried to
touch the filesystem, it'd get some dummy module when requiring `"fs"`
that would pretend to be doing file system operations on top of
localstorage. That part never really got widely used, since you mostly
want to run modules that don't need file access in the browser, but
for some things like the built-in assert or resolve modules it can be
helpful.

What a bundler like browserify has to do, which our bundler didn't, is
to help the modules get access to each other's interfaces. It not only
has to make sure the dependencies are part of the bundle, but also
that when you call `require`, it actually returns the interface of the
dependency.

There is an additional catch. Namely, in principle, the string you
pass to `require` (or AMD `define`) is just a value. It's usually a
string literal, but it doesn't have to be—it could be any expression,
such as a reference to a variable that was previously computed in some
hugely complicated way. As such, you only really know what is being
required when you _run_ the program. Which is too late, for the
bundler, so bundlers typically only work on dependencies that are
specified with plain string literals.

Let's write a CommonJS bundler. In the 2012 directory, you find our
web app in CommonJS format. jQuery, rather than being copied in
manually, is now installed through NPM.

If we were doing this properly, we'd need to fully parse the modules,
and then look through the syntax tree to find calls to `require`,
while taking care to make sure that they are actually referring to the
global `require`, not some local variable with the same name. But for
this exercise, you are welcome to just run a regular expression over
the code that looks for something that resembles a call to require.

You can then do something similar to the primitive bundler, following
dependencies and adding any files you can reach, but you have to wire
up the `require` calls to the right code. Since the strings they pass
don't unambiguously identify modules (there's resolution involved),
one relatively straightforward way to put all modules (wrapped in
functions) into an array, and to rewrite the argument to `require` to
be an index into this array instead.

So you'd get something like this:

    !function(modules) {
      var loaded = []
      function require(i) {
        if (!loaded[i]) {
          var mod = loaded[i] = {exports: {}}
          modules[i](mod.exports, require, mod)
        }
        return loaded[i].exports
      }
      require(0)
    }([
      function(exports, require, module) { ... }
      function(exports, require, module) { ... }
    ])

The wrapper shim again tracks which modules it has already loaded, and
defines a simple require function, which will be passed to each
individual module. It starts by loading the first module in the array,
which is assumed to be the starting script.

---

So then, the community unanimously agreed to all use CommonJS modules,
and we could forget about all that.

Hahah no. There has been a move towards publishing things as CommonJS
on NPM by default, but in 2015, the new ECMAScript standard (6 / 2015)
included a _new_ module system, quite incompatible with the others,
and defined in a way that definitely didn't make it possible to
include it in 'universal' module loader headers.

Why did they even do that? Well, there are some good reasons. For one
thing, our bundler, and all other bundlers, have been pretending that
imports are static, whereas they are really dynamic—module names can
be computed—which is a bit of a conceptual mismatch.

Also, when interfaces are just values, it is rather hard to
automatically check them to see whether the things you are importing
are actually exported by your dependency module.

And finally, the ergonomics of CommonJS and AMD, especially when it
comes to exporting, are pretty awful, getting you things like:

    let f = exports.f = function f() { ... }

Whereas, with `export` being a language keywords, you can simply say:

    export function f() { ... }

These are pretty minor, but I do think they help—going from CommonJS
to ES modules really makes code more pleasant. Unfortunately, a
serious roadmap for how the community will start using these wasn't
part of the standard.

In short, our example module would now look like this:

    import $ from "jquery"
    export class Paper { ... }

Exports are no longer a value, but rather a set of named _bindings_,
which may _change_ after being imported. There's a special export
named `default` that you get when you simply import a name. To import
named bindings, you say

    import {a, b, c} from "module"

Engines were pretty quick to implement most of the ES6 standard, but
modules have taken much longer. For the web, a standard for `<script
type=module>` has been written, browsers are starting to ship it, some
still behind a flag. However, it doesn't specify any module resolution
beyond 'it's a URL relative to the current module', which means that
it's not possible to run code written to import modules by name, or
even code that omits the `.js` extension, directly in the browser.

The story with node is also rather complicated. The node devs are
working on support for such modules, but due to some parts of the
design of this module system, specifically that you have to know in
advance whether something is a module or a regular script when parsing
it, this has been a difficult and controversial process.

The current plan appears to be to require ES modules to get the
extension `.mjs`, and allow interop between CommonJS modules and ES
modules in the same system. Node _would_ resolve ES module names the
same way as `require`-d names, so I expect that would work pretty
well. Might be a while before it ships, though.

For the browser, bundling, also during development, seems to remain
the only viable solution. But given the plethora of other dialects
that also require a compilation step, i.e TypeScript, Flow, JSX, and
the use of half-standardized experimental language features, it seems
that the community has mostly accepted that our source language isn't
directly runnable anyway, so that we need a tooling step anyway—at
which point you might as well also add a bundler.

When it comes to bundling ES modules, the fact that they are defined
in a more static way does create the opportunity for much nicer bundle
output. Remember all the extra wrapper functions and the indirection
of going through `require` to import things in our bundler?
(Browserify's output is actually quite a bit worse—for good reasons.)

When you have a system consisting of a lot of small modules, the
overhead, both in code size and in run-time overhead, of this wrapping
becomes significant. The 'rollup' tool for bundling ES modules did
much better. It is able to put a bunch of modules into a single scope.
For example turning this:

    let x = 10
    export function y() { return x }

    import {y} from "./other.js"
    console.log(y())

Into simply:

    let x = 10
    function y() { return x }
    console.log(y())

Not only is there no extra glue code, the `import` and `export` parts
simply vanished, making the output code _smaller_ than the input code.
So that's pretty cool. There's a few complications, of course -- if
the second file also had a variable named `x`, that'd have to be
renamed. But renaming variables in JS code isn't hard, since scopes
are static — minifiers do it, for example.

This type of bundling is possible because ES modules share _bindings_,
rather than values, which can be resolved and connected statically.
Basically, exported bindings are 'merged' with the bindings that
import them, resulting in a single binding in a shared scope.

So ES modules bundle quite well, and are probably the future. Yet they
don't really run natively yet, and if you're publishing to NPM, you
should be providing your code as CommonJS modules. There is a sort-of
convention of adding a `module` field to your package.json pointing at
ES module code, alongside `main` pointing at CommonJS code, but that's
not standardized yet, and the way it works is likely to change as
node.js' support is developed, so that's not really looking great.

There's a plugin for rollup that translates (some kinds of) CommonJS
modules into ES modules on the fly and then rolls them up. This
obviously doesn't work for all code, but _most_ modules are written to
export only some static bindings, and those can be automatically
translated without losing anything. Others do have to retain their
wrapper, but can still become part of a wider rolled-up bundle.

And needing tooling to run is no longer a very surprising thing. Whole
tribes of JS developers are writing TypeScript, Flow, or JSX code,
which also doesn't run 'natively' in any JS engine, and requires a
compilation step.

So I suppose we'll just have to resign ourselves to a compilation
step. This can be very awkward during testing, but there are ways
around that. Most tools come with a 'watch' feature where they'll
automatically, incrementally recompile/rebundle when any module
changes. Even better are webservers that make sure to recompile your
files as-needed when you fetch them, so that you don't accidentally
refresh before the recompilation finishes.

There's also systems that implement something called 'hot reloading',
where they'll update your code in a running app whenever you change
anything. I don't like this much, since you're much more likely to run
into inconsistent state if you keep running the same JS image.

Another issue that comes up when working with compiled code is that
the code that the browser is running isn't the code that you wrote.
That was awkward for a bit, where you had to figure out what line in
your actual code the line in the error message is referring to, but
fortunately browsers added support for source maps, which are data
structures mapping positions from the output file to position in the
original file, which can be included in your code through magically
formatted comments, either inline in the source file or by specifying
the path of a separate file.

The 2015 directory has the example app written as ES modules, and
rollup installed. Figure out how to set up rollup so that you can
conveniently develop with it.

---

Once you start using other people's code, or more generally any code
that's not maintained inside a single repository, you have to start
worrying about compatibility.

Notably, you don't just depend on a given library, you depend on a
given instance of a library. Older or newer instances likely won't
work—older ones may not have the features you need, newer ones may
have made changes to or dropped things that you were relying on.

This is why we have versions, and it's another area where NPM sets a
convention. NPM requires each release of a package to be tagged with a
unique version, following the 'semantic versioning' (semver) style of
version numbers.

In short, that means that version number look like 1.2.3, and that
there are rules about how you update your version number when you
change something. Versions that differ only in the patch number are
supposed to have the exact same interface. Those that differ only in
minor and patch, the higher versions are backwards-compatible with the
lower, but may have introduced new features that weren't present
before. And a change in the major version means that breaking changes
were made, and you can't blindly upgrade.

Unfortunately, semantic versioning doesn't magically fix upgrading
problems for us. New versions do come with new bugs, so sometimes
upgrading to something that semver says is safe will break your code.
You might even accidentally be relying on behavior that the developer
considers broken, and which they fixed in a new release.

The easiest thing would be if you just installed a given version of a
library, notice that it works with your system, and then never think
about it again. There are several reasons why this doesn't work well.

The first is rather obvious: there might be some terrible bug in the
library that you haven't noticed yet, and it might be fixed in newer
releases. There have been several widely-publicised instances of
really bad security problems in widely used modules that continued to
be exploited long after the libraries themselves had brought out fixed
versions. So that's an argument for upgrading things.

This is why package.json will often specify a version _range_, rather
than a single version. For example `^4.2.2`, which says 'any version
greater or equal to 4.2.2 and less than 5.0.0'. There's a bunch of
operators and notations you can use in your package.json version
fields, but you usually want either the caret or a specific version.

Version ranges are important to deal with a major problem that package
managers have to solve, namely that in a bigger project you often end
up with multiple packages relying on the same package. In the past, up
to version 3, NPM had a very peculiar way, compared to other package
managers, of installing subdependencies. It would simply duplicate
them, under the dependency's directory.

Due to the way node resolves package names, if a file in
`node_modules/foo` asks for dependency `"bar"` and there's a
`node_modules/foo/node_modules/bar` package installed, it'll use that
one. So this works -- you just create a directory tree directly
isomorphic to the dependency tree, and off you go.

But there are some problems with that. For very modular systems, where
lots of packages share the same dependency, it can end up installing a
ridiculous amount of code. At one point, trying to run Babel as
installed by NPM 2 had a five-second startup time because it was
loading many, many copies of the same packages, and you had to run
`npm dedupe`, which removes duplicated dependencies after the fact, to
get things running properly. Also, bundling such a redundant tree for
the browser is of course a disaster, since there, the size of the code
is even more important.

You can also get very interesting bugs from duplicated dependencies.
If a module has any kind of state, for example allowing you to
register plugins, you better hope that the instance where the plugin
was registered is the same one through which you're trying to use it,
or it won't be there. Also `instanceof` checks are likely to fail if
the constructor you're testing against comes from a different instance
than the one that actually created the object.

So this, while simple, wasn't great, and since NPM 3 the tool tries to
install dependencies in a 'flat' structure, putting as many of them as
possible directly under your main project's `node_modules` directory.

Now, if you have a 'diamond dependency', a dependency referenced by
more than one package, NPM will try to find a version that matches the
version ranges of all packages that require the package. If that
fails, it'll still fall back to duplicating it. (But at least it can
-- there are a lot of languages where this is simply impossible, and
you can get stuck on such a conflict, being unable to install
something. This is usually referred to as 'dependency hell'.)

So that's a little messy, and still definitely gets in the way in some
situations, but it mostly works.

Then there's the issue of reproduceable installs. When you have
version ranges for any dependency, or one of your dependencies uses
version ranges, what you get when you install depends on which
versions are currently available in the NPM registry. So you don't
really know in advance, which produces the awkward effect that, after
testing a system on one machine, deploying it to another machine can
cause everything to break because a new broken release of one of your
dependencies was published in the meantime.

So that's bad. To counteract this, NPM used to have a 'shrinkwrap'
feature, which has become the default behavior, under the new name
'package lock' since version 5. This basically splits installation
into two steps—first, compute a set of dependency versions that
satisfy your dependency requirements, store the result of that in a
file (`package-lock.json`), and _then_ actually install these versions
in your `node_modules` directory. You can then store or commit this
package lock file, and be sure that, when installing in production,
you get the exact same effect.

This complicates things further, but solves the problem of having to
constantly deal with new versions being installed. Updating is now no
longer something that happens implicitly on reinstall, because of a
version range you specified, but an action you take. Which is
preferable.

When you have a big dependency tree, bundling into a single file is no
longer very attractive. For a web-app that does a bunch of different
things, using a bunch of big libraries, you'll easily fill megabytes
of code, which has to be loaded and parsed as a whole before the app
does anything.

Fortunately, people are constantly running into all these problems and
coming up with clever solutions. In this case, the tool we're
interested in is Webpack, another bundler.

Webpack does pretty much everything. It's not as specialized and
elegant a tool as browserify or rollup, but for packaging up modern,
complicated web apps, it's probably the best solution. It has plugins
for things like directly importing CSS files to make sure they are
loaded when your app loads, importing image files (the result will be
a path to your image, which is automatically copied into your output
directory), and _splitting bundles_, which is the feature we're
interested in.

To be able to do this, it requires control over an output directory,
rather than just spitting out a single file, and a lot more
configuration. But so it goes.

Code splitting extends bundling by making some imports dynamic. The
app is bundled up to these points, but all code that only has to be
loaded after a dynamic import is put into a separate bundle, which
will be loaded when the import is actually executed. Such imports must
look differently, since they happen asyncronously and can happen
anywhere, not just at the top level. Webpack currently uses the syntax
`import(...)`, which is a proposed addition to the standard, for this
purpose. This is an expression which returns a promise that resolves
to the imported module's interface object. (Similar to `*
as`-imports).

Doing this kind of bundling by hand gets really awkward fast, but
computers are great at it -- the secondary bundle will include all
dependencies that were needed by the dynamically imported file, except
those that were already in the main bundle, and code added by the
bundler will make sure everything is connected properly when the
secondary bundle is loaded.

The last exercise, labeled 2017, deals with Webpack.
